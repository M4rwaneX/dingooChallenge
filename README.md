## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Firstly, the data doesn't have any missing values. 
It has `4745 entries` with 4 columns : `CÃ³d.Postal`,`Localidade`,
`Morada completa`,`GPS - Latitude` and `GPS - Longitude`.  

Since I have access to coordinates, I decide to plot the distribution of deliveries by locations:

And zoomed, we get :

The first thing that surprises me is that globaly, 
we have a huge cluster with some few points that we will have to treat apart.  

We can look for where the density is the highest using a density map :

Not surprisingly, the highest density is near the city center.

I tried to see how postal codes are distribuated, It gives a good idea what zones 
are covered.

## Clusters

Now that we have an idea of what the data is and how It is represented, we are going to look for
clusters of locations.  
Since the number of locations inside a cluster is a parameter, I am going to use `KMEANS`.
It will use centroids that will choose locations that minimizes the distance from them.
By the way, these centroids will give us a good position for the restock "hub" because in each cluster,
the centroids have the lowest distance from each locations of the cluster.
