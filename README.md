## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Firstly, the data doesn't have any missing values. 
It has `4745 entries` with 4 columns : `Cód.Postal`,`Localidade`,
`Morada completa`,`GPS - Latitude` and `GPS - Longitude`.  

Since I have access to coordinates, I decide to plot the distribution of deliveries by locations:

And zoomed, we get :

The first thing that surprises me is that globaly, 
we have a huge cluster with some few points that we will have to treat apart.
